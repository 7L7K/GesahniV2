# Rate Limiting Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing 429 (Too Many Requests) errors when the auth orchestrator made multiple rapid calls to `/v1/whoami`. The logs showed:

```
[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 429 (Too Many Requests) (whoami, line 0)
[Error] AUTH Orchestrator: Auth check failed: ‚Äì Error: HTTP 429: Too Many Requests
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Default Rate Limits Too Low**: The default rate limit was 60 requests per minute, which was insufficient for development scenarios
2. **Rapid Successive Calls**: The auth orchestrator was making multiple calls to `/v1/whoami` in quick succession without proper throttling
3. **No Backoff Strategy**: When rate limited, the system would immediately retry without exponential backoff
4. **No Development Bypass**: Authenticated users in development mode were still subject to rate limiting

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Rate Limits for Development

**File**: `env.consolidated`
```bash
# üîê Rate limiting - Higher limits for development
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN=300
RATE_LIMIT_BURST=50
```

- Increased from 60 to 300 requests per minute
- Added burst limit of 50 requests
- Provides more headroom for development scenarios

### 2. Development Mode Rate Limit Bypass

**File**: `app/security.py`
```python
# Development mode: bypass rate limits for authenticated users
dev_mode = os.getenv("DEV_MODE", "0").strip().lower() in {"1", "true", "yes", "on"}
if dev_mode:
    try:
        payload = getattr(request.state, "jwt_payload", None)
        if not isinstance(payload, dict):
            payload = _get_request_payload(request)
        if isinstance(payload, dict) and payload.get("user_id"):
            # Bypass rate limits for authenticated users in dev mode
            return True
    except Exception:
        pass
```

- Added `DEV_MODE=1` to environment configuration
- Authenticated users bypass rate limits in development mode
- Maintains security in production while improving developer experience

### 3. Improved Auth Orchestrator Rate Limiting

**File**: `frontend/src/services/authOrchestrator.ts`

#### Added Rate Limiting State
```typescript
// Rate limiting and backoff state
private consecutiveFailures = 0;
private backoffUntil = 0;
private readonly MIN_CALL_INTERVAL = 2000; // 2 seconds minimum between calls
private readonly MAX_BACKOFF = 30000; // 30 seconds max backoff
private readonly BASE_BACKOFF = 1000; // 1 second base backoff
```

#### Added Throttling Logic
```typescript
private shouldThrottleCall(): boolean {
    const now = Date.now();
    
    // Check if we're in backoff period
    if (now < this.backoffUntil) {
        const remaining = this.backoffUntil - now;
        console.info(`AUTH Orchestrator: In backoff period, ${remaining}ms remaining`);
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check minimum interval between calls
    if (now - this.lastWhoamiCall < this.MIN_CALL_INTERVAL) {
        const remaining = this.MIN_CALL_INTERVAL - (now - this.lastWhoamiCall);
        console.info(`AUTH Orchestrator: Too soon since last call, ${remaining}ms remaining`);
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

#### Added Exponential Backoff
```typescript
private calculateBackoff(): number {
    // Exponential backoff with jitter
    const backoff = Math.min(
        this.BASE_BACKOFF * Math.pow(2, this.consecutiveFailures),
        this.MAX_BACKOFF
    );
    // Add jitter (¬±20%)
    const jitter = backoff * 0.2 * (Math.random() - 0.5);
    return Math.max(1000, backoff + jitter);
}
```

#### Enhanced Error Handling
```typescript
if (response.status === 429) {
    // Rate limited - apply backoff
    this.consecutiveFailures++;
    const backoffMs = this.calculateBackoff();
    this.backoffUntil = Date.now() + backoffMs;
    console.warn(`AUTH Orchestrator: Rate limited (429), backing off for ${backoffMs}ms (failure #${this.consecutiveFailures})`);
    throw new Error(`HTTP 429: Too Many Requests - backing off for ${backoffMs}ms`);
}
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite to verify improvements:

**File**: `test_rate_limit_simple.py`
- Tests rate limiting configuration
- Tests bypass logic for authenticated users
- Verifies auth orchestrator improvements
- Validates environment configuration

## Results

‚úÖ **All tests pass**
- Rate limiting configuration: 300/min, 50 burst
- Bypass logic working correctly
- Auth orchestrator improvements in place
- Environment configuration correct

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates 429 Errors**: Higher rate limits and bypass logic prevent rate limiting issues in development
2. **Better User Experience**: Auth orchestrator no longer gets stuck in rate limit loops
3. **Improved Reliability**: Exponential backoff prevents cascading failures
4. **Development Friendly**: Authenticated users bypass rate limits in development mode
5. **Production Safe**: Rate limiting still enforced in production environments

## Configuration Summary

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` | 300 | Increased from 60 for development |
| `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | 50 | Added burst limit for development |
| `DEV_MODE` | 1 | Enables development-friendly features |
| `MIN_CALL_INTERVAL` | 2000ms | Minimum time between whoami calls |
| `MAX_BACKOFF` | 30000ms | Maximum backoff time for rate limits |
| `BASE_BACKOFF` | 1000ms | Base backoff time for exponential backoff |

## Files Modified

1. `env.consolidated` - Added rate limiting and development mode settings
2. `app/security.py` - Added development mode bypass logic
3. `frontend/src/services/authOrchestrator.ts` - Added comprehensive rate limiting improvements
4. `test_rate_limit_simple.py` - Created test suite for verification

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Watch for any remaining 429 errors in development
2. **Tune**: Adjust rate limits if needed based on usage patterns
3. **Production**: Ensure rate limits are appropriate for production deployment
4. **Documentation**: Update developer documentation with new rate limiting behavior
