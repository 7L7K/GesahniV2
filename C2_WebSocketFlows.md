## WebSocket Flows: endpoints, topics, publishers

### Endpoints (with 10 receipts)

| Method | Path | Subscriptions | Handler | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS | /v1/ws/care | Client subscribes by sending `{action:"subscribe", topic:"resident:{id}"}` | app/api/care_ws.py::ws_care | Topic registry `_topics` with per-topic sets |
| WS | /v1/ws/music | No explicit subscribe; server pushes topic-tagged frames | app/api/music.py::ws_music | Broadcasts use `{topic, data}` frames |
| WS | /v1/transcribe | N/A (streaming RPC) | app/api/sessions.py::websocket_transcribe | Transcription stream orchestrator |
| WS | /v1/storytime | N/A (streaming RPC) | app/api/sessions.py::websocket_storytime | Transcription + JSONL logging |

### Topic map (publishers and timing)

- resident:{resident_id}
  - alert.created: published by `app/api/care.py::create_alert` after creating a care alert; why: notify caregivers of a new alert.
  - alert.acknowledged: published by `app/api/care.py::ack_alert` after ack; why: update listeners that alert is acknowledged.
  - alert.resolved: could be added; `care.resolve_alert` does not currently broadcast (future enhancement). Why: lifecycle completion.
  - tv.config.updated: published by `app/api/tv.py::tv_put_config` after saving TV config; why: live TV config hot-reload.

- music.state
  - published by `app/api/music.py::music_command`, `set_vibe`, `restore_volume`, and `set_device` after state changes; why: sync UI state across clients.

- music.queue.updated
  - published by `app/api/music.py::get_queue` after queue retrieval; why: update UI with queue size changes.

- device.heartbeat
  - not broadcast today via WS; tracked in metrics in `care.heartbeat`. It is listed in `events_example` to document expected events. Why: potential future live presence updates.

### Where I got this
- WS endpoints, subscription, and broadcast helpers in `app/api/care_ws.py` and `app/api/music.py`.
- Event publishers in `app/api/care.py`, `app/api/tv.py`, and `app/api/music.py`.
- Session streaming endpoints in `app/api/sessions.py`.
