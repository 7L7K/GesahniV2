# Authentication Acceptance Criteria Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of all authentication acceptance criteria to ensure a robust and secure authentication system.

## Acceptance Criteria Overview

The following criteria must be met (pass/fail):

1. **Zero 401s from your own protected endpoints during app boot**
2. **Exactly one finisher call per login and one whoami immediately after**
3. **whoamiOk never "flips" after it settles; no oscillation logs**
4. **No component issues a whoami besides the orchestrator**
5. **All privileged API calls (music/state/status) occur only when authed === true**
6. **WS does not trigger whoami on errors; no reconnect loops**

## Implementation Details

### 1. Zero 401s from Protected Endpoints During App Boot

**Problem**: Silent refresh middleware was disabled, potentially causing 401s during app initialization.

**Solution**:
- Re-enabled silent refresh middleware in `app/main.py`
- The middleware automatically refreshes access tokens when they're nearing expiry
- Prevents 401s by proactively rotating tokens before they expire

**Files Modified**:
- `app/main.py`: Uncommented silent refresh middleware

**Test**: `test_zero_401s_during_boot()` in `test_auth_acceptance_criteria.py`

### 2. Exactly One Finisher Call Per Login and One Whoami Immediately After

**Problem**: Auth orchestrator and bootstrap manager coordination needed improvement to ensure proper sequencing.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced auth orchestrator to track finisher calls and whoami calls
- Added event listeners for auth finish start/end events
- Implemented automatic whoami call after auth finish completion
- Added rate limiting to prevent rapid successive whoami calls

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/services/authOrchestrator.ts`: Added finisher call tracking and automatic whoami after finish

**Key Features**:
- Tracks finisher call count
- Automatically calls whoami 100ms after auth finish completes
- Prevents whoami calls during auth finish process
- Minimum 1-second interval between whoami calls

**Test**: `test_finisher_and_whoami_sequence()` in `test_auth_acceptance_criteria.py`

### 3. whoamiOk Never "Flips" After It Settles; No Oscillation Logs

**Problem**: whoamiOk state could oscillate between true/false, causing UI instability.

**Solution**:
- Added stable `whoamiOk` state to auth orchestrator
- Only updates whoamiOk when authentication status actually changes
- Removed local debounced whoamiOk state from main page
- Uses centralized state management to prevent oscillation

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/services/authOrchestrator.ts`: Added stable whoamiOk state
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`: Removed local whoamiOk state management

**Key Features**:
- Stable whoamiOk state that only changes when auth status changes
- Centralized state management prevents multiple components from updating state
- Clear logging when authentication status changes

**Test**: `test_whoami_no_oscillation()` in `test_auth_acceptance_criteria.py`

### 4. No Component Issues a Whoami Besides the Orchestrator

**Problem**: Multiple components could potentially call whoami directly, causing race conditions.

**Solution**:
- Auth orchestrator is the ONLY component allowed to call `/v1/whoami`
- Development helper detects direct whoami calls and warns developers
- All components must use auth orchestrator's state instead of calling whoami directly

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/services/authOrchestrator.ts`: Added development helper to detect direct whoami calls

**Key Features**:
- Development warning when direct whoami calls are detected
- Clear documentation that only orchestrator should call whoami
- Centralized authentication state management

**Test**: `test_only_orchestrator_calls_whoami()` in `test_auth_acceptance_criteria.py`

### 5. All Privileged API Calls Occur Only When authed === true

**Problem**: Some UI components could make privileged API calls without checking authentication status.

**Solution**:
- Added authentication checks to all music API calls in UI components
- Ensured music state fetching only occurs when authenticated
- Protected WebSocket connections with authentication checks

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/lib/uiEffects.ts`: Added auth checks to music API calls
- `frontend/src/app/tv/music/page.tsx`: Added auth checks to music controls
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`: Ensured music state fetching is gated by authentication

**Key Features**:
- All music API calls check authentication status before proceeding
- Clear error messages when not authenticated
- WebSocket connections only start when authenticated

**Test**: `test_privileged_api_calls_gated()` in `test_auth_acceptance_criteria.py`

### 6. WS Does Not Trigger Whoami on Errors; No Reconnect Loops

**Problem**: WebSocket connections could trigger whoami calls on errors, causing reconnect loops.

**Solution**:
- Updated WebSocket hub to not call whoami on connection errors
- Limited reconnection attempts to prevent infinite loops
- Uses global auth state instead of calling whoami directly

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/services/wsHub.ts`: Removed whoami calls on WebSocket errors

**Key Features**:
- WebSocket errors don't trigger whoami calls
- Limited reconnection attempts (max 1 per requirement)
- Uses auth orchestrator state instead of direct whoami calls

**Test**: `test_websocket_no_whoami_on_errors()` in `test_auth_acceptance_criteria.py`

## Testing

### Automated Test Suite

Created comprehensive test suite in `test_auth_acceptance_criteria.py` that verifies all acceptance criteria:

```bash
python test_auth_acceptance_criteria.py
```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **App Boot Test**:
   - Start the application
   - Verify no 401 errors in console during initialization
   - Check that whoami endpoint always returns 200

2. **Login Flow Test**:
   - Perform login
   - Verify exactly one finisher call
   - Verify one whoami call immediately after
   - Check that whoamiOk state is stable

3. **Authentication State Test**:
   - Verify whoamiOk doesn't oscillate
   - Check that only auth orchestrator calls whoami
   - Confirm privileged API calls are gated

4. **WebSocket Test**:
   - Verify WebSocket connections work when authenticated
   - Check that errors don't trigger whoami calls
   - Confirm no infinite reconnect loops

## Monitoring and Logging

### Key Log Messages

- `AUTH Orchestrator: Finisher call #X started/ended`
- `AUTH Orchestrator: Calling /v1/whoami (call #X)`
- `AUTH Orchestrator: Authentication status changed from X to Y`
- `ðŸš¨ DIRECT WHOAMI CALL DETECTED!` (development only)

### Metrics

- Finisher call count tracking
- Whoami call count tracking
- Authentication status change logging
- WebSocket connection failure tracking

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `JWT_ACCESS_TTL_SECONDS`: Access token lifetime (default: 1800s)
- `ACCESS_REFRESH_THRESHOLD_SECONDS`: When to refresh tokens (default: 3600s)
- `JWT_REFRESH_TTL_SECONDS`: Refresh token lifetime (default: 604800s)

### Development Settings

- Development helper detects direct whoami calls
- Detailed logging for authentication state changes
- Rate limiting prevents rapid successive calls

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Rotation**: Automatic token rotation prevents token expiration issues
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of authentication endpoints
3. **Centralized State**: Single source of truth for authentication state
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of authentication failures
5. **WebSocket Security**: Authentication required for WebSocket connections

## Future Improvements

1. **Metrics Dashboard**: Add authentication metrics to monitoring dashboard
2. **Alerting**: Set up alerts for authentication failures
3. **Performance**: Optimize token refresh timing
4. **Testing**: Add more comprehensive integration tests

## Conclusion

All acceptance criteria have been implemented and tested. The authentication system now provides:

- âœ… Zero 401s during app boot
- âœ… Proper finisher/whoami sequencing
- âœ… Stable whoamiOk state
- âœ… Centralized whoami calls
- âœ… Gated privileged API calls
- âœ… WebSocket error handling without whoami calls

The system is robust, secure, and ready for production use.
