# Authentication Monitoring Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of structured logging and monitoring for authentication events in GesahniV2, as requested in the original requirements.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Structured Logs

**Auth Event Types:**
- ✅ `auth.finish.start/end` - Authentication finish process timing
- ✅ `auth.whoami.start/end` - Whoami endpoint call timing  
- ✅ `auth.lock.on/off` - Authentication lock events
- ✅ `auth.authed.change` - Authentication state changes

**Log Fields Added:**
- `auth_event_type` - Type of authentication event
- `auth_user_id` - User identifier
- `auth_source` - Authentication source (cookie, header, clerk)
- `auth_jwt_status` - JWT validation status (ok, invalid, missing)
- `auth_session_ready` - Whether session is ready
- `auth_is_authenticated` - Whether user is authenticated
- `auth_lock_reason` - Reason for lock events
- `auth_boot_phase` - Whether during boot phase

### 2. Prometheus Counters

**Implemented Counters:**
- ✅ `whoami_calls_total{status, source, boot_phase}` - Total whoami endpoint calls
- ✅ `finish_calls_total{status, method, reason}` - Total auth finish endpoint calls
- ✅ `privileged_calls_blocked_total{endpoint, reason}` - Total blocked privileged calls
- ✅ `ws_reconnect_attempts_total{endpoint, reason}` - Total WebSocket reconnection attempts

**Additional Metrics:**
- ✅ `auth_event_duration_seconds{event_type, status}` - Authentication event timing histogram

### 3. Dashboard Alerts

**Boot Phase Alerts:**
- ✅ **Multiple whoami calls during boot**: Alert when more than 1 whoami call is detected within 2 seconds during boot phase
- ✅ **401 errors during boot**: Alert when any 401 errors are detected from APIs during boot phase

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Core Monitoring Module (`app/auth_monitoring.py`)

**Key Functions:**
- `log_auth_event()` - Log structured authentication events
- `track_auth_event()` - Context manager for timing authentication events
- `record_whoami_call()` - Record whoami endpoint calls with metrics
- `record_finish_call()` - Record auth finish endpoint calls with metrics
- `record_privileged_call_blocked()` - Record blocked privileged calls
- `record_ws_reconnect_attempt()` - Record WebSocket reconnection attempts
- `record_auth_lock_event()` - Record authentication lock events
- `record_auth_state_change()` - Record authentication state changes

**Boot Phase Detection:**
- Automatically detects first 30 seconds as boot phase
- Configurable via `_BOOT_PHASE_DURATION` constant
- Used for alerting on boot-specific issues

### Integration Points

**Authentication Endpoints:**
- `/v1/whoami` - Monitors all whoami calls with timing and metrics
- `/v1/auth/finish` - Monitors auth finish process with method and reason tracking

**Security Layer:**
- `verify_token()` - Monitors 401 errors with reason classification
- `verify_token_strict()` - Monitors strict authentication failures

**WebSocket Layer:**
- HTTP requests to WebSocket endpoints - Monitors reconnection attempts

### Grafana Dashboard

**Panels:**
1. **Whoami Calls During Boot** - Stat panel with alert for >1 calls
2. **401 Errors During Boot** - Stat panel with alert for any 401s
3. **Whoami Calls by Status** - Time series of call patterns
4. **Auth Finish Calls** - Time series of finish call patterns
5. **Privileged Calls Blocked** - Time series of blocked calls
6. **WebSocket Reconnection Attempts** - Time series of reconnection patterns
7. **Auth Event Duration** - Heatmap of event timing
8. **Authentication Success Rate** - Gauge showing success percentage
9. **Total Auth Events** - Stat showing total event count

**Alerts:**
- **Multiple whoami calls during boot**: Threshold >1, 1-minute frequency
- **401 errors during boot**: Threshold >0, 1-minute frequency

## 🧪 Testing

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests for all monitoring functions
- Integration tests for endpoint monitoring
- Error handling tests
- Boot phase detection tests

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Run auth monitoring tests
pytest tests/test_auth_monitoring.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/test_auth_monitoring.py --cov=app.auth_monitoring --cov-report=html
```

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Logging Authentication Events
```python
from app.auth_monitoring import log_auth_event

log_auth_event(
    event_type="whoami.call",
    user_id="user123",
    source="cookie",
    jwt_status="ok",
    session_ready=True,
    is_authenticated=True
)
```

### Tracking Event Timing
```python
from app.auth_monitoring import track_auth_event

with track_auth_event("whoami", user_id="user123"):
    # Authentication logic here
    pass
```

### Recording Specific Events
```python
from app.auth_monitoring import record_whoami_call

record_whoami_call(
    status="success",
    source="cookie",
    user_id="user123",
    session_ready=True,
    is_authenticated=True,
    jwt_status="ok"
)
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Environment Variables
- `PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=1` - Enable Prometheus metrics (default: enabled)
- `AUTH_MONITORING_ENABLED=1` - Enable auth monitoring (default: enabled)

### Dashboard Setup
1. Import `grafana_auth_dashboard.json` into Grafana
2. Configure Prometheus data source
3. Set up notification channels for alerts
4. Customize alert thresholds as needed

### Metrics Endpoint
- Available at `/metrics` when Prometheus is enabled
- Includes all authentication metrics with proper labels

## 🔍 Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Monitor boot phase closely** - Authentication issues during startup indicate configuration problems
2. **Track 401 error patterns** - Sudden spikes may indicate token expiration or security issues
3. **Watch WebSocket reconnections** - Frequent reconnections may indicate network or authentication instability
4. **Monitor authentication success rates** - Should remain high (>99%) in normal operation

## 🎯 Alert Thresholds

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Whoami calls during boot**: >1 (indicates potential auth loops)
- **401 errors during boot**: >0 (indicates auth configuration issues)
- **Authentication success rate**: <95% (indicates systemic auth problems)
- **WebSocket reconnections**: >10/min (indicates connection instability)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Authentication lock tracking** - Monitor rate limiting and lockout events
2. **Session analytics** - Track session duration and patterns
3. **Geographic tracking** - Monitor authentication by location
4. **Device fingerprinting** - Track authentication by device type
5. **Real-time alerts** - Webhook notifications for critical auth failures
6. **Machine learning** - Anomaly detection for unusual auth patterns
