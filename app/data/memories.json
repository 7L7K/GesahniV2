Blue light is scattered in all directions by these tiny molecules of air, more so than other colors because it travels in shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time.

This phenomenon is called Rayleigh scattering, which affects shorter wavelengths like blue more than longer wavelengths like red or yellow. On the other hand, the sun looks yellow because it emits light in all colors, but the atmosphere scatters blue light, causing the sun's direct light, which is less scattered and thus yellower, to reach our eyes.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, just let me know!",

Meanwhile, the sun appears yellow because it emits light across the spectrum, but when it passes through the thicker part of the atmosphere (especially at sunrise and sunset), the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered out, leaving the longer red and yellow wavelengths more dominant.\n\nNeed more info on light and color?
