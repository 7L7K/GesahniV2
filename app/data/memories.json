      "answer": "If you're looking for an action-packed movie, I recommend \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" (2015). It's a high-octane, visually stunning film directed by George Miller. The movie follows Max Rockatansky, played by Tom Hardy, and Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, as they navigate a post-apocalyptic wasteland and face off against tyrannical warlords. It's filled with incredible action sequences and has received critical acclaim for its direction, stunts, and visual effects.",
