This allows data to be packed more tightly, offering higher storage capacity.\n\n- **Data Layer**: The disc contains multiple layers of data, allowing for more content and higher-quality video and audio.\n\n- **Playback**: Blu-ray players read the data using the blue-violet laser and process it for display on your TV or device.\n\n- **Compatibility**: While Blu-ray players are backward compatible (playing DVDs and CDs), Blu-ray discs require a specific player to be read.\n\nDo you want to know anything else about Blu-ray?",
